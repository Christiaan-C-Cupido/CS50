 GUI (Graphical User Interface):
 A GUI is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with a computer system or software through graphical elements such as windows, icons, buttons, menus, and other visual components. It is designed to be user- 
 friendly and intuitive, often requiring minimal technical knowledge.

 Example: Operating systems like Windows and macOS, or applications like web browsers and photo editors.

CL (Command Line):
  A CL (Command Line) or Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface that allows users to interact with a computer system or software by typing commands into a terminal or console. It is more efficient for 
  advanced users but requires familiarity with specific commands and syntax.

  Example: Terminal on Linux/macOS or Command Prompt/PowerShell on Windows.

In the terminal window, some common command-line arguments we may use include:
 cd, for changing our current directory (folder)
 cp, for copying files and directories
 ls, for listing files in a directory
 mkdir, for making a directory
 mv, for moving (renaming) files and directories
 rm, for removing (deleting) files
 rmdir, for removing (deleting) directories
