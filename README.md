Week 0: Scratch

Week 1: C

 GUI (Graphical User Interface):
 A GUI is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with a computer system or software through graphical elements such as windows, icons, buttons, menus, and other visual components. It is designed to be user- 
 friendly and intuitive, often requiring minimal technical knowledge.

 Example: Operating systems like Windows and macOS, or applications like web browsers and photo editors.

CL (Command Line):
  A CL (Command Line) or Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface that allows users to interact with a computer system or software by typing commands into a terminal or console. It is more efficient for 
  advanced users but requires familiarity with specific commands and syntax.

  Example: Terminal on Linux/macOS or Command Prompt/PowerShell on Windows.

In the terminal window, some common command-line arguments we may use include:
 cd, for changing our current directory (folder)
 cp, for copying files and directories
 ls, for listing files in a directory
 mkdir, for making a directory
 mv, for moving (renaming) files and directories
 rm, for removing (deleting) files
 rmdir, for removing (deleting) directories

Types
printf allows for many format codes. Here is a non-comprehensive list of ones you may utilize in this course:

%c = Represents a single character

%f = Represents a floating-point number (e.g., float).

%i/%d = Represents an integer (same as %d).

%li = Represents a long integer.

%s = Represents a string (null-terminated character array).
