GUI (Graphical User Interface):
A GUI is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with a computer system or software through graphical elements such as windows, icons, buttons, menus, and other visual components. It is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, often requiring minimal technical knowledge.

Example: Operating systems like Windows and macOS, or applications like web browsers and photo editors.

CL (Command Line):
A CL (Command Line) or Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface that allows users to interact with a computer system or software by typing commands into a terminal or console. It is more efficient for advanced users but requires familiarity with specific commands and syntax.

Example: Terminal on Linux/macOS or Command Prompt/PowerShell on Windows.
